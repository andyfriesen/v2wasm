Here is how to make an import library for the MIDAS Digital Audio System
for use with Mingw32-GCC or Cygwin32 (the Windows ports of GCC).

* First create the import library with dlltool
Use the following command:
dlltool -U --output-lib libmidas.a --dllname midas11.dll --def midasdll.def

* Midasdll.h must be changed.
The following should be added to midasdll.h:
    #if defined(__MINGW32__) || defined(__CYGWIN32__)
       #define _FUNC(x) __attribute__ ((stdcall)) x
       #define MIDAS_CALL

* Ready to go!

I haven't tried MIDAS with Cygwin32, but it should work the
same way as with Mingw32. The binary included (libmidas.a)
is made for for Mingw32 and midas11.dll (1.1.1).
